# VIBE-WRITE-2K
## What This Is
This is a fully AI-coded text editor that is intended to be suitable for novel and short story writing.

## What This Is Not
This is not a replacement for a true word processor (Pages, Word, etc.), this isn't intended to be a replacement for dedicated writing tools (Scrivener).
This is really meant to be more of a replacement for WriteMonkey or other minimalist word processors.  

## Why Are You Doing This?
It's really a test.  I wanted to see how AI software development tools (primarily Claude Code and Codex) work on something that isn't super trivial 
or super complicated.  This is something I've been wanting to sit down and find time to work on. 

## My Thoughts
I'm pretty impressed.  All the code you see in this repo (sans a few updates to .gitignore and this readme) is entirely generated by Codex and Claude. 
I have not touched any of the source files and I've tried to delineate which commits come from which tool.  In total I have spent less than 10 hours 
to get this stood up and I have just a little bit more to go on it before I consider it ready enough to build and use for writing longer term.

## Can I Contribute?
Not right now, but thanks for asking.  Again, this is really just a personal passion project.  Nothing serious.
